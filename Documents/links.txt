TODO:

I: Report
1. Scope of reproducibility : 2 use_cases. need more info....

2. Dataset Description: remove minor details. explain the source,

3. Methodology  Computational requirements
    - type of hardware,
    - avg runtime for each epoch,
    - total number of trial,
    - GPU hrs used,
    - # training epochs

4. Results: use table. and plot. ?


5: Discussion:
     - Implications of the experimental results, whether the original paper was reproducible, and if it wasn’t,
     what factors made it irreproducible
     - dataset is different from what paper suggested.
     - what was easy?   code is relatively clean, need some upgrade. minor changes.
         data set is already in the repo. we already have code to clean the data.
         console intermediate output is high quality, pipeline is good.
     - what was hard?
         ....................
     -  Recommendations to the original authors or others who work in this area for improving reproducibility

6. Extra credit:  send an email to the author. ask about the missing data.

II: Presentation: 4 minute, PPT, upload to Youtube.
    - Software: camtasia9


III: Code.
改ReadMe.
  - python 3 branch.
  -missing key.
  - get rid of the GPU code.
  - plot?? maybe.
